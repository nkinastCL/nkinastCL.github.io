Privacy Policy for CL Authoring Extension
Effective Date: 2/4/2025

Introduction
The CL Authoring Extension Chrome extension is designed to automate interaction with CLIC components, extract JSON data from the console, and download it into a configuration file. This privacy policy outlines the extension's data handling practices, including what data it collects, how it is used, and your rights as a user.

What Information Do We Collect?
The CL Authoring Extension extension does not collect, transmit, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data. The extension operates entirely on your local device, and any data processed by the extension remains within your browser session.

Specifically:

The extension interacts with the content of the webpage you are currently visiting to identify and click a button with the title attribute title="Save".
The extension captures console logs generated by the webpage to extract a JSON string. This data is processed locally and is not transmitted outside your device.
When generating a configuration file, the extension prompts you to enter a unique identifier (ID). This ID, along with the extracted JSON data, is used only to create the configuration file on your local device.
How Do We Use the Information?
The data captured (console logs and your unique ID) is used exclusively for the following purposes:

Extracting the JSON data from the console logs after clicking the "Save" button on the page.
Generating a downloadable configuration file that contains the JSON data and your provided unique ID.
No data is transmitted, shared, or stored by the extension. All operations occur locally within your browser.

What Information Do We Share?
We do not share any information with third parties. Since the extension does not collect or transmit user data, there is no information to share.

Security Practices
The extension processes all data locally within your browser. It does not transmit or store any data on external servers, ensuring your privacy and security. Additionally, the extension does not request permissions beyond those necessary for its core functionality.

Permissions Justification
activeTab Permission: This permission is required to interact with the currently active tab. It enables the extension to send a message to the content script running on the active page, allowing it to locate and click the "Save" button.

scripting Permission: This permission is necessary to inject scripts into the webpage. The script temporarily overrides the console's behavior to capture logs, enabling the extension to extract JSON data.

Host Permissions: The extension requires host permissions to execute its content script on webpages where users wish to use it. This ensures the extension can interact with the "Save" button and extract the required data from the console logs.

Data Retention
The extension does not retain any user data. All captured data is processed and discarded immediately after use, remaining entirely within the browser session. Generated configuration files are stored only on your local device and are not accessible to the extension after creation.

User Control
You maintain complete control over how the extension operates:

The extension only activates when you explicitly interact with its popup interface.
You can uninstall or disable the extension at any time through your browser's extensions settings.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in functionality or regulatory requirements. Any changes will be posted on the extension's Chrome Web Store page with the updated effective date.
